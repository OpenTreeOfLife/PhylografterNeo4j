<h2>
Synthesis of angiosperm phylogeny
</h2>

<p>Molecular systematic studies continue to yield new knowledge about
the relationships, ages etc. of particular branches of the angiosperm
Tree of Life. How do we synthesize these results and
produce <b>maximally comprehensive and accurate trees</b>?  Here, we
hope to gather and organize the necessary information, and make it
pubically available.</p>

<p>Specifically, we aim to provide:</p>

<ol>
<li>A database of <b>source trees</b>, i.e., trees derived from
published studies, archived node-by-node, with associated data
(publication info, aligned sequences, Genbank ids, gene and genome
info, support values, age estimates, etc.).  Most importantly, nodes
(both OTUs and internal clades) are cross-referenced across trees
by <b>taxon</b>.</li>

<li>An intuitive and convenient interface for <b>grafting</b> source
trees together, to create increasingly comprehensive trees.</li>

<li> <b>Analytical tools</b> for (a) guiding additional sampling of
taxa and genes, and (b) creating new taxon-by-gene combinations for
analysis.</li>
</ol>

{{nstudies = db(db.study.id>0).count()}}
{{nstrees = db(db.stree.id>0).count()}}
{{notus = db(db.otu.id>0).count()}}
{{ntaxa = len(db(db.otu.taxon!=None).select(db.otu.taxon, distinct=True))}}

<p>The database currently contains {{=nstudies}}
<a href="{{=URL(c='study',f='index')}}">studies</a> and
{{=nstrees}} <a href="{{=URL(c='stree',f='index')}}">source trees</a>,
representing {{=notus}} OTUs and {{=ntaxa}} distinct terminal taxa.
Hey, it's a start.</p>
